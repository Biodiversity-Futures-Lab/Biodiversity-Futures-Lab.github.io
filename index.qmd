Welcome to the website of the Biodiversity Futures Lab (BFL) at the [Natural History Museum](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/) 
in London! Lab members mostly compile and synthesise evidence about how human actions affect biodiversity and nature's 
contributions to people. We use a range of modelling approaches, often with the aim of helping decision-makers choose 
better options for people and nature.

We want a more positive future Earth's biodiversity and a fairer future for people. We are therefore willing to work 
with any organisation that we believe is working towards one or both of these goals, and that is not working against 
either of them. As a result, BFL's work encompasses commercial-facing projects and policy-related work as well as 
more traditionally academic research.
