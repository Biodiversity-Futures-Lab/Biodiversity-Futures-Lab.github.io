**New paper in** [**Science**](https://www.science.org/journal/science) *(4th April 2025)* -- Are 
insects in rapid global decline? If so, what would turn things around? 
The latest paper from the [GLiTRS](https://glitrs.ceh.ac.uk/) project, [Integrating 
multiple evidence streams to understand insect biodiversity 
change](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq2110), spells out why these 
are still open questions, despite their high profile over recent years. It argues 
that time-series data, such as those coming from monitoring programmes, are too 
patchy and biased to give a clear picture of any global trend, and that combining 
different lines of evidence into a synthetic threat-response model can provide a 
deeper understanding. As well as being among the paper's authors, Andy was interviewed 
for an article about it on the [NHM news site](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2025/april/to-save-insects-we-need-to-understand-their-decline.html).
