- **New paper in** [**Science**](https://www.science.org/journal/science) *(4th April 2025)* -- Are insects in rapid global decline? If so, what would turn things around? The latest paper from the [GLiTRS](https://glitrs.ceh.ac.uk/) project, [Integrating multiple evidence streams to understand insect biodiversity change](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq2110), spells out why these are still open questions, despite their high profile over recent years. It argues that time-series data, such as those coming from monitoring programmes, are too patchy and biased to give a clear picture of any global trend, and that combining different lines of evidence into a synthetic threat-response model can provide a deeper understanding. As well as being among the paper's authors, Andy was interviewed for an article about it on the [NHM news site](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2025/april/to-save-insects-we-need-to-understand-their-decline.html).
