## Biodiversity Intactness Index tutorial

[**The Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) tutorial**](https://adrianadepalma.github.io/BII_tutorial/) gives an example of how to model and project the BII using a subset of the PREDICTS (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity in Changing Terrestrial Systems) data.

## `predictsr` R package

The `predictsr` package retrieves PREDICTS project datasets openly available on the Natural History Museum Data Portal, specifically from the 2016 and 2022 data releases. Available on CRAN: [predictsr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/predictsr/index.html)
