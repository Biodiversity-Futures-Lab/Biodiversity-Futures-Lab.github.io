This page provides an overview of the resources produced by our lab, including code tutorials and tools to support analysis, openly available data products for research and exploration, recordings of talks and presentations by lab members and collaborators, and demonstration videos that showcase our methods and findings.

# Code

- [**The Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) tutorial**](https://adrianadepalma.github.io/BII_tutorial/) gives an example of how to model and project the BII using a subset of the PREDICTS (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity in Changing Terrestrial Systems) data.
- [`predictsr` **R package**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/predictsr/index.html) retrieves PREDICTS project datasets openly available on the [NHM Data Portal](https://data.nhm.ac.uk), specifically from the 2016 and 2022 data releases. It is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/predictsr/index.html).


# Data

- [**Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) summaries**](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/bii-bte), providing country, region, and global-level BII summaries from 1970 to 2050, under various scenarios.
- **PREDICTS project data releases**: The PREDICTS (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity in Changing Terrestrial Systems) project provides open access data on terrestrial biodiversity responses to land-use change. The data is available on the Natural History Museum Data Portal, or through the `predictsr` R package:
  - [2016 data release](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/the-2016-release-of-the-predicts-database-v1-1)
  - [2022 data release](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/release-of-data-added-to-the-predicts-database-november-2022)

# Talks

- [**Bending the Curve of Biodiversity Loss Requires a 'Satnav' for Nature**](https://www.youtube.com/live/usIIB71oxtE?t=16296) *(13th June 2023)* -- Professor Andy Purvis at The Royal Society; Andy starts speaking at [4:31](https://www.youtube.com/live/usIIB71oxtE?t=16296) in the video below.

# Videos

- [**Why should we be worried about biodiversity loss?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFN21MYiZ8A) Find out from Biodiversity Futures Lab members why biodiversity is a cornerstone of life on Earth and why we should care. Short film produced by Celeste de Kock, who completed a placement in the lab.
