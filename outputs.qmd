# Code

- [**The Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) tutorial**](https://adrianadepalma.github.io/BII_tutorial/) gives an example of how to model and project the BII using a subset of the PREDICTS (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity in Changing Terrestrial Systems) data.
- [`predictsr` **R package**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/predictsr/index.html) retrieves PREDICTS project datasets openly available on the Natural History Museum Data Portal, specifically from the 2016 and 2022 data releases. It is available on CRAN: [predictsr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/predictsr/index.html).


# Data

- [**Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) summaries**](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/bii-bte), providing country, region, and global-level BII summaries from 1970 to 2050, under various scenarios.
- **PREDICTS project data releases**: The PREDICTS (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity in Changing Terrestrial Systems) project provides open access data on terrestrial biodiversity responses to land-use change. The data is available on the Natural History Museum Data Portal, or through the `predictsr` R package:
  - [2016 data release](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/the-2016-release-of-the-predicts-database-v1-1)
  - [2022 data release](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/release-of-data-added-to-the-predicts-database-november-2022)
