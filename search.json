    "text": "Welcome to the website of the Biodiversity Futures Lab (BFL) at the Natural History Museum in London! Lab members mostly compile and synthesise evidence about how human actions affect biodiversity and nature’s contributions to people. We use a range of modelling approaches, often with the aim of helping decision-makers choose better options for people and nature.\nWe want a more positive future Earth’s biodiversity and a fairer future for people. We are therefore willing to work with any organisation that we believe is working towards one or both of these goals, and that is not working against either of them. As a result, BFL’s work encompasses commercial-facing projects and policy-related work as well as more traditionally academic research.\n(This site is still very much a work-in-progress, so please bear with us as we add more content and keep it updated.)\nThis is a Quarto website.\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites."

    "text": "BII featured in Fixing Our Broken Planet exhibition (8th April 2025) – The Museum’s brilliant new exhibition includes a quote about BII from Sabine Nix, from her time in BFL. The exhibition’s opening featured on Channel 4 News. \nNew paper in Science (4th April 2025) – Are insects in rapid global decline? If so, what would turn things around? The latest paper from the GLiTRS project, Integrating multiple evidence streams to understand insect biodiversity change, spells out why these are still open questions, despite their high profile over recent years. It argues that time-series data, such as those coming from monitoring programmes, are too patchy and biased to give a clear picture of any global trend, and that combining different lines of evidence into a synthetic threat-response model can provide a deeper understanding. As well as being among the paper’s authors, Andy was interviewed for an article about it on the NHM news site."

Projects include studying the effects of ocean acidification on marine bryozoans, predicting climate-driven changes in body size, and using AI to analyze plant traits for biodiversity indicators. Additionally, the lab employs genomic tools to accelerate the discovery of parasitoid wasps, enhancing their potential as biocontrol agents. By integrating advanced technologies, the lab aims to improve our understanding of biodiversity and its future."
